# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

Based on the data trends we can fisrt look at when would be the best time to launch a successful Kickstarter campaign.

In this graph we can see that the months of May and June both have a greater success rate of theatre Kickstarter launches. We can even see that while most of the successful campaigns that begin around May and June, that rate of success lowers by the end of the year. In conclusion, the data suggest the goal for a launch date should be in either May, or June.

Next lets looks at outcomes based on Parent Categories and Subcategories.

Here we can see that of the overall Kickstartes around the world theatre has the most campaigns, and of the 1,393 campaigns 839 of them where successful, meaning there is a 60% success rate.

Looking at the US alone there is a grand total of 912 Theatre Kickstarters, with 525 of them being successful.

Breaking it down into the subcategories we can see that plays overall have a large amount of Kickstarters around the world, with a grand total of 1,066 campaings and with a success rate of 65%.

 We can even directly look at Great Britian which has a grand total of 314 play Kickstarters and a success rate of 76%.

If we want to look at the data from our Edingurgh Festival Fringe reasearch, we can see that the plays campaigns reached all of their goals, with average donations of $40.48, and an average amount of backers of 62 people.

When we look at the Descriptive Stastics analysis of Succesful and Failed US Kickstarters we can determine that  the failed Kickstarter campaigns have higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns.  Although, if we look specifically at the mean and median pledged amounts between successful and failed campaigns we can see that they are much lower on the failed campaigns than the successful pledges. This can lead us to believe that failed Kickstarter campaigns are possible unsuccessful for reasons other than to high of a funding goal. Still considering the data, for a more succesful outcome a lower campaign goal should be considered.
